# Car-Pool
 A carpool system based on microservices employs ADO.NET for database access, WebAPI for inter-service communication, and MVC for the frontend. Key services include booking a ride, offering a ride, and displaying available rides post-registration and login. This architecture prioritizes simplicity and efficiency for ride-sharing functionality.
